      <h2>STAR Story #1: Pivot Under Pressure</h2>
      <div class="help">
        After quiet a few years of working in education, I had reached a point where I felt that I wanted to grow. I
        enjoyed helping kids learn, but I didn’t see a sustainable future for myself in the role. I felt stuck between
        staying in a familiar job or taking a risk on something completely different. After stepping away from teaching,
        I decided to start working in a restaurant to stay afloat financially while I figured out my next direction. It
        was a dramatic shift, and the pressure came from not knowing what the next stable step would look like.<br><br>
        I understood that I needed to reassess what I actually wanted my career to look like and identify a path that
        offered growth, intellectual challenge, and long-term stability. I needed to make a decision quickly enough to
        avoid drifting, but thoughtfully enough that I wouldn’t repeat the same cycle of feeling misaligned. The
        challenge was balancing immediate responsibilities with the bigger goal of pivoting into a field where I had no
        prior professional experience.<br><br>
        I approached the pivot the same way I would approach a complex project: by breaking it down into clear,
        manageable decisions. I started by evaluating what I enjoyed most in both teaching and kitchen work, and found
        that problem solving, structure, fast feedback loops, and systems thinking were areas that felt challenging, but
        rewarding. Those patterns pointed me toward information systems. Once I made the decision, I created a plan to
        return to school while continuing to work. I researched degree programs, mapped out financing options, and built
        a realistic timeline that allowed me to ramp up my technical skills without burning out. Throughout the
        transition, I kept myself motivated by setting weekly goals to complete coursework, improving my SQL skills, and
        connect with people already working in the field I hope to join. When doubts showed up, I reframed them as
        signals that I was doing something challenging and worthwhile.<br><br>
        While still on my way, I feel that I’ve successfully made the pivot and am now working towards a career in
        information systems. The process taught me how to adapt under pressure, how to make structured decisions in
        uncertain situations, and how to maintain momentum even when the next step isn’t fully clear. Most importantly,
        I proved to myself that I can completely change direction and still come out stronger, more focused, and more
        capable than when I started.

      <h2>STAR Story #2: Leading Without Authority</h2>
      <div class="help">While working on the prep team in a busy restaurant, I didn’t hold a lead or supervisory title,
        but our team relied heavily on prep work to keep service running smoothly. During peak seasons, we often
        struggled with inconsistent prep quality and low stock levels on the line, which created stress for the chefs
        and slowed down service. The kitchen was fast-paced, and there wasn’t always someone available to guide newer
        team members or step in when things started falling behind.<br><br>
        Even without a formal leadership role, I felt responsible for helping the team function more smoothly. The
        challenge was to support new staff, improve day-to-day organization, and keep morale steady during high-pressure
        rushes, while still managing my own workload and staying within the boundaries of my position.<br><br>
        I started by paying closer attention to where breakdowns were happening. I noticed that new prep cooks often
        weren’t confident about recipes or best prep order, so I took the initiative to walk them through our standards,
        show them shortcuts I’d learned, and answer questions they had. Instead of waiting for the line to run out of
        ingredients, I checked in regularly and kept a running list so I could refill items before they became an issue.
        During rushes, I made a point of staying calm, offering quick help, and giving positive reinforcement through
        small things like, “You’re doing great, keep going,” which helped newer staff feel supported rather than
        overwhelmed. None of this required authority, but it did require consistency, communication, and a willingness
        to take
        initiative.<br><br>
        Things became noticeably more organized, and the line cooks started experiencing fewer shortages during service.
        New employees ramped up faster and told me that my walkthroughs made them feel more comfortable and confident.
        The chefs began trusting me to onboard new prep cooks because they knew I was patient, thorough, and reliable.
        This experience taught me that leadership doesn’t depend on a title, but rather comes from stepping in where
        you’re needed, helping others feel capable, and setting a tone of calm and collaboration even when things get
        chaotic.

    <section class="section" id="stakeholders">
      <h2>STAR Story #3: Quality Recovery</h2>
      <div class="help">While working at a tutoring center, I noticed that sometimes the quality of instruction become
        inconsistent across different tutors. Some were rushing through explanations, skipping key steps, or not
        following the center’s teaching framework. This led to uneven student progress and occasional parent concerns.
        There wasn’t a formal quality-control process in place, so these issues often went unnoticed unless someone
        specifically observed the session.<br><br>
        As part of my management role, I was responsible for maintaining the standard of education that families
        expected. My goal was always to address the decline in instructional quality, support tutors who were
        struggling, and create a more consistent experience for students without making instructors feel criticized or
        singled out.<br><br>
        I typically started by observing instructors more intentionally, paying attention to patterns rather than
        one-off mistakes. Once I identified the main gaps such as rushed pacing, unclear explanations, or missing
        follow-ups, I approached tutors individually in a supportive way. Instead of pointing out what they were doing
        wrong, I explained why certain techniques mattered and shared practical tips I used myself, like breaking
        problems into smaller steps or using quick comprehension checks. When tutors asked for more help, I offered to
        sit with them and go over our methods further in depth so that they could get more practice. To reinforce
        quality, I modeled best practices and made sure to acknowledge improvement. My goal was to make quality feel
        achievable, not burdensome.<br><br>
        Within a few weeks, I typically saw noticeable improvement in instructors that went through this extra training.
        They became more confident and started asking more questions about how to handle difficult concepts. Parents
        continued to give positive feedback, and the center ran more smoothly as a whole. This experience taught me how
        effective coaching can be and how small, supportive interventions can raise quality across a team.

    <section class="section" id="stakeholders">
      <h2>STAR Story #4: Managing Difficult Stakeholder</h2>
      <div class="help">As a director at the same tutoring center, I frequently worked with families who expected
        immediate academic improvement from their children. Some parents were frustrated when they didn’t see instant
        results and questioned whether the program was effective. Their impatience created tension, especially because
        our approach focused on strengthening foundational skills which naturally takes time.<br><br>
        My responsibility was to address their concerns, reset expectations, and ensure they felt confident in both the
        process and the progress their child was making. The challenge was to build trust with families who were anxious
        and resistant to hearing that learning requires consistency rather than quick fixes.<br><br>
        I scheduled one-on-one meetings with each concerned family to understand the root of their frustration. I
        listened first, letting them express their worries without interruption. Then I walked them through our teaching
        method, explaining how skills build on each other and why mastery takes time. To make the process more tangible,
        I pulled real progress data from our assessments and showed them exactly where their child had started, what
        improvements we were already seeing, and what the next steps would be. I also shared success stories from other
        students who followed the program and eventually made significant improvements. I made a point to communicate
        calmly, avoid overly technical language, and frame everything around their child’s long-term success. After each
        meeting, I followed up with short check-ins to keep them updated and reinforce that their child was on the right
        track.<br><br>
        Most families shifted from frustration to understanding, and many expressed relief after seeing concrete
        evidence of their child’s progress. Their trust in the program grew, which led to fewer escalations and a more
        positive working relationship overall. This experience strengthened my ability to engage resistant stakeholders
        by combining empathy, clear communication, and data-driven transparency. It also taught me how powerful
        consistent follow-up can be in maintaining alignment.

      <h2>STAR Story #5: Fostering Psychological Safety</h2>
      <div class="help">In my role as a director at a tutoring center, I noticed that some instructors were hesitant to
        share their ideas or concerns. Many were used to being told exactly what to do and worried about “doing
        something wrong” if they made independent choices. This created an environment where people followed
        instructions but didn’t always speak up when they had insights that could improve lessons, scheduling, or
        student engagement.<br><br>
        My goal was to build a culture where instructors felt comfortable contributing their ideas, raising concerns
        early, and making everyday decisions within a clear framework. I wanted them to feel trusted and valued, not
        micromanaged or second-guessed.<br><br>
        I started by explicitly inviting input during team meetings, asking open-ended questions like, “What’s working
        well?” and “What would make the sessions run more smoothly?” When someone offered an idea, I made sure to
        respond with appreciation and curiosity, never dismissal. I also created a clear framework of expectations so
        instructors knew the boundaries they could operate within. Inside that structure, I encouraged them to make
        their own decisions on how to approach instruction, handle minor issues, or adjust strategies for individual
        students.<br><br>
        To reinforce safety, I shared examples of times when I made adjustments based on staff feedback, highlighting
        that their perspectives genuinely shaped operations. I also made myself consistently approachable, checking in
        casually and giving space for people to voice concerns without fear of judgment.
        The culture of the center was noticeably positive. Instructors offered creative ideas for student engagement,
        communicated concerns earlier, and took more ownership of their work. Team morale was consistently positive, and
        people expressed that they felt heard, trusted, and excited to come to work. This experience taught me how
        powerful psychological safety can be and how when people feel valued, they participate more, collaborate more,
        and ultimately elevate the quality of the entire workplace.
